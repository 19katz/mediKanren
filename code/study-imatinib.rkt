;; we want a direct link bewteen imatinib and GIST
;; like TREATS predicate
;; or something like that
;; and no direct link bwteen imatinib and Asthma
;; which is what we are "discovering"
;; I think that is the basic idea
;; we already "know" that imatinib treats CML and GIST
;; through direct links
;; and are trying to discover other diseases it might treat
;; but want to go through genes that are already known to be safe
;; that imatinib is already known to target

;; the example is interesting because the query isn't just linear
;; we want to find a tree, not a path

;; Greg says:

;; the structure of an edge is:
;; (subject object predicate subject-type object-type pred-info)

;; So instead of looking for "gngm" in the type list of a concept, you can instead use subject-type or object-type to constrain the edge itself.
;; so:
;; (== `(,s-imatinib/gene ,m-imatinib/gene ,p-imatinib/gene . ,e-rest-imatinib/gene) e-imatinib/gene)

;; becomes (with fresh st-imatinib/gene):
;; (== `(,s-imatinib/gene ,m-imatinib/gene ,p-imatinib/gene st-imatinib/gene "gngm". ,e-rest-imatinib/gene) e-imatinib/gene)

;; then you no longer have to use membero



;; Will says:

;; What Greg says above, but stronger!  Using member can allow too many entry types--think of it as a "fuzzy" version of a query!  You asked for a gene?  Well, here are genes, and proteins, and ...



;;; one step at a time!

;; TODO all direct edges from all types of imatinib

;; TODO count the number of times each gene appears inhibited, across all versions of imatinib

;; TODO find all the subgraphs of the form 'some variant of imatinib INHIBITS some specific gene which CAUSES some specific disease or neoplasm which is directly TREATED by that version of imatinib'.  Ideally, fully explore most specific entities before broadening to categories.


;; Ah!  Now Will is enlightened!  I *need* to use "gngm" as the object type in the query, rather than calling membero on the list of associated types.
;; This will keep me from accidentally picking up aapp|T116|Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein, for example, when I want genes.





;; TODO try strategy of most-specific to least-specific, based on branching factor for the next "hop" during a query




;; TODO intersection of relatively specific "dsyn", "neop", and "patf" directly treated by the relatively specific imatinib synonyms with the relatively specific "dsyn", "neop", and "patf" directly caused by the relatively specific genes (or gene groups) inhibited by the relatively specific imatinib synonyms



;; TODO relatively specific "dsyn", "neop", and "patf" that are directly caused by relatively specific genes inhibited by relatively specific imatinib synonyms


;; TODO intersection of "dsyn", "neop", and "patf" directly treated by the imatinib synonyms with the "dsyn", "neop", and "patf" directly caused by the genes (or gene groups) inhibited by the imatinib synonyms


;; TODO "dsyn", "neop", and "patf" that are directly caused by the genes (or gene groups) inhibited by the imatinib synonyms



;; TODO: How many of the cell functions below for KIT/C-KIT are unique?  And how many of those are specific enough to be meaningful/useful?
;; try taking the union* of all the non-silly entries

;; throw out the 'howler' genes from the query below:
;;
;;   (100 (597357 "receptor" ("aapp" "gngm" "rcpt")))

;; So, insisting on "gngm" as the subject type cuts down on stray proteins when we want genes.  What about "orch" (orch|T109|Organic Chemical) vs. "phsu" (phsu|T121|Pharmacologic Substance) for the subject type?  For "CGP 57148", the INHIBITS edges always have "orch" as the subject type.  What about for "imatinib", "Imatinib mesylate", "STI571", and "Gleevec"?  There are a handful of uses of "phsu" as the edge type for the other aliases, but these seem more noise than a specific pattern.  Doesn't look like anything we can exploit.
